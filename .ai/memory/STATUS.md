## Current Focus

F-005 — SubscriberEventConsumer — **in progress**.

## Recently Completed

- **F-001 Task 003** — Resolvers, AppContext, and GraphQL router wired for ChargingTrace. All three query methods functional end-to-end. `go test -race ./...` passes. Completed 2026-03-20.
- **F-001 Task 002** — `ChargingTraceService` implemented in `internal/backend/services/`. All three methods (list, count, by-ID) with UUID parsing, column map, and model mapper. Unit tests pass including race detector. `store.NewTestStore` helper added to enable service-level mocking. Completed 2026-03-20.
- **F-001 Task 001** — `gql/schema/charging_trace.graphql` created; gqlgen regenerated `models_gen.go`, `generated.go`, and `charging_trace.resolvers.go` (stubs). Build clean. Completed 2026-03-20.
- **ChargingTrace store layer** — ListChargingTraces, CountChargingTraces, FindChargingTraceByTraceId. Unit tests. Completed 2026-03-20.
- **QuotaResource** — Balance queries + reserve/debit/cancel mutations. GraphQL schema + service + resolvers complete. Kafka wired to charging-backend. Completed 2026-03-20.
- **QuotaManager.GetBalance** — `BalanceQuery`, `CounterBalance`, `GetBalance` added to `internal/quota`. Read-only domain primitive for balance inquiries. Committed 2026-03-19.
- Reverse-engineered project state and created memory/DECISIONS.md and memory/STATUS.md
- RatePlanResource — GraphQL CRUD + approval state machine
- NumberPlanResource — GraphQL CRUD
- ClassificationResource — GraphQL CRUD + approval state machine
- CarrierResource — GraphQL CRUD + dynamic filter/pagination
- charging-backend scaffold — auth, GraphQL handler, REST router
- Model package refactor — moved to internal/model, Plan → ClassificationPlan rename
- charging-engine — full NCHF charging pipeline
- charging-dra — Diameter Ro interface

## Open Questions

- RatePlan has two update queries (`UpdateRatePlan` and `UpdateRatePlanRules`) with a
  TODO comment in the SQL — confirm which to keep and remove the other.
- Keycloak `auth.enabled: false` toggle works for local dev — confirm whether this
  is the intended pattern for CI/test environments or if a separate test config is needed.

## Known Deferred Items

- GraphQL subscriptions — not implemented, not currently required
- Role-based authorisation on individual endpoints — auth middleware validates the token
  but no per-endpoint role checks are implemented yet
- Wholesaler admin endpoints — wholesaler table exists in DB, no GraphQL resource yet
- Subscriber admin endpoints — subscriber table exists in DB, no GraphQL resource yet
- Pagination optimisation — current implementation uses OFFSET which degrades on large
  datasets; cursor-based pagination not yet implemented
